In addition, Planting Justice is in the process of transferring ownership of its nursery land to the local Ohlone community, through the indigenous women-owned Sogorea Te’ Land Trust, and can talk through that process with us.\n\nIf you're curious about urban farming, combatting food apartheid, non-traditional business models like pay-as-you-can, workforce re-entry programs, the indigenous land-back movement, or generally getting involved with a cool food non-profit, this event is for you!\n\nThe $5 cost to attend will secure your spot and be donated directly to Planting Justice.\n\n*Note, there may also be an opportunity to volunteer after the talk and get our hands dirty on the farm, details forthcoming*\n---\nEvent Details: https://haas.campusgroups.com/rsvp?id=2250909",

Over the past few decades, Dan has seen a complete transformation in the brewing industry and has learned a lot about entrepreneurship along the way. Come for some free beer and learn from someone that's experienced it all in entrepreneurship.\n\nAbout Gordon Biersch:\n\nGordon Biersch Brewery was founded by Dan Gordon and Dean Biersch. Gordon, a graduate from the five-year brewing engineering program at Weihenstephan, Germany, and Biersch opened their first brewery restaurant in Palo Alto, California in July 1988. In 1999, the restaurants were sold to what ultimately became CraftWorks Restaurants & Breweries. In November 1995, the two founders and their original investors, wanting to expand their then $20-million business, accepted a $11.2 million investment from the Fertitta family of Las Vegas. Since 1998, Gordon Biersch Brewing Company has more than doubled its production, increasing its capacity to 3.1 million gallons of beer annually, making Gordon Biersch Brewing Company one of the largest breweries in the San Francisco Bay Area and giving it a national reputation.\n---\nEvent Details: https://haas.campusgroups.com/rsvp?id=2250988",
